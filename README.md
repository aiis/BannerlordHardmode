# A Simple Hardmode for Bannerlord

This mod is an intro for me to Bannerlord modding with [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony).

### Changes
* Increased damage player takes (2x the dmg of default realistic setting)
* Increased player's troops wages  (5x)
* Increased food consumption for player's party (x2.5)
* Halved food consumption for player's party when in a village, castle or town
* Increased morale loss from defeats for player's party (-30 instead of -20)
* Decreased base morale for player's party (30 instead of 50)
* Increased threshold of troop desertion (25 instead of 10)

### Installation
1. Download zBannerlordHardmode.zip located in the build folder
2. Unzip file
3. Drag contents to *YourMountAndBladeInstallation*/Modules folder
4. Enable in launcher

##### Note: If you have problems launching, you can try unblocking the dll file of the mod.
1. Navigate to *YourMountAndBladeInstallation*/Modules/zBannerlordHardmode/bin/Win64_Shipping_Client
2. Right click BannerLordHardmode.dll and select properties
3. At the very bottom of the window, check Unblock if it appears.

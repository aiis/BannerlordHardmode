# A Simple Hardmode for Bannerlord

This is a simple mod intended to make the game Bannerlord more challenging and provide a bit more strategic depth to the game. The goal isn't difficulty for the sake of difficulty. The goal is to make constantly roaming the countryside with an elite army, kicking everyone's ass without a worry in the world, difficult.

### Installation
1. Download zBannerlordHardmode.zip from [**RELEASES**](https://github.com/aiis/BannerlordHardmode/releases)
2. Unzip file
3. Drag contents to *YourMountAndBladeInstallation*/Modules folder
4. Enable in launcher

### Compatability
So far none of the releases of this mod have required a new save game. And the save games work after disabling the mod. That said, it's always a good idea to back up save games if they are very important to you.
Does this mod work with *some other mod*? It depends. If they try changing the same thing in the game, then chances are you will have issues.

#### If you have problems launching, you can try unblocking the dll file of the mod.
1. Navigate to *YourMountAndBladeInstallation*/Modules/zBannerlordHardmode/bin/Win64_Shipping_Client
2. Right click BannerLordHardmode.dll and select properties
3. At the very bottom of the window, check Unblock if it appears.
